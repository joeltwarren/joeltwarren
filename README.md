- 👋 Hi, I’m @joeltwarren
- 👀 I’m interested in C# development of any kind! I am begginning to learn more about blockchain technology in the hopes of creating a auto trading bot from scratch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# from Western Governors University Online. I have previously had about 6 month of online training from Full Sail University and obtained a certificate for C# basics. I was moving into swift when I decided that I prefered C# and chose to pursue a degree in C# only instead of using it for a stepping stone for another language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project you need help with to further my knowledge. I have been working on a console based DND campaign just to brush up on my coding. 
- 📫 Reach me via email @ jtw.wolf@gmail.com
