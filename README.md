- 👋 Hi, I’m @joeltwarren
- 👀 I’m interested in C# development of any kind! I am begginning to learn more about blockchain technology in the hopes of creating an auto crypto trading application from scratch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# from Western Governors University Online. I have previously obtained a graduate certificate for application development fundamentals from Full Sail University in C#. I was moving into swift for mobile application development when I decided that I prefered C# and chose to pursue a degree in software engineering instead.
- I am an active member and moderator of the C# players guide discord server. https://discord.gg/Wx8VMUbk68
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project you need help with to further my knowledge. I am working through the C# players guide 5th edition to brush up on my skills
take a look at the work I've completed in my CSharpPlayersGuide5thEdition repository.
